# FoodOrdering
An online food ordering system allows your business to accept and manage orders placed online for delivery or takeaway. Customers browse a digital menu, either on an app or website and place and pay for their order online.

# What I Learned

Order Management: The Python code likely demonstrated how to manage food orders efficiently. This includes tasks like taking user input for the desired items, calculating the total cost, and ensuring accurate representation of the order before finalizing it.

Data Structures: You might have learned about different data structures used to organize information in the context of food ordering. Python's lists or dictionaries have been used to store menu items, their prices, and user-selected items.

User Interaction: The code probably showcased how to interact with users effectively. This could involve presenting menu options, handling user preferences and modifications to their orders, and providing clear prompts for input.

Conditional Logic: You might have learned how to use conditional statements in Python. These would have been used to validate user inputs, calculate the total order amount, and apply any discounts or special offers.
